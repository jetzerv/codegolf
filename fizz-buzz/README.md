# Code Golf Challange :: Fizz Buzz
```
Print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive, each on their own line.

If, however, the number is a multiple of three then print Fizz instead, and if the number is a multiple of five then print Buzz.

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five then print FizzBuzz.

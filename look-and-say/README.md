# Code Golf Challange :: Look and Say

```
The Look and Say sequence starts with 1 and is continued by looking at each of the runs of the same number in the previous element and combining the length with the original number. For example the next element after 111221 would be 312211 (three ones, two twos and one one).

Print the first 20 elements of the Look and Say sequence.
